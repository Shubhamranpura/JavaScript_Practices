  <h1>Destructuring in js </h1>
  <p>The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables</p>
  <strong>
    The destructuring assignment uses similar syntax but uses it on the left-hand side of the assignment instead. It defines which values to unpack from the sourced variable
