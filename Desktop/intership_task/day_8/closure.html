    <h1>Returning Functions with Closures</h1>
    <h2>First we have to under stand what is lexical Scope in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Lexical scope is a fundamental concept in programming that determines the accessibility of variables and functions based on where they are defined in the source code. In simple terms, lexical scope is the scope of a variable or function determined at compile time by its physical location in the code. Unlike dynamic scope, which depends on how functions are called at runtime, lexical scope is static and remains the same throughout the programâ€™s execution.
    </p>
    <h2>what is closure?</h2>
    <p>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
