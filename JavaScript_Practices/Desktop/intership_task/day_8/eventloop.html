  <h1>Event Loop and Callback Queue</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is known for its ability to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, even though it is single-threaded.
    This article will help you understand what it means for JavaScript to be single-threaded, how the event loop works,
    and how JavaScript manages to keep your applications responsive.

  <h1>What does it mean when we say JavaScript is single-threaded?</h1>
  When we say that JavaScript is single-threaded, it means that JavaScript executes code one line at a time, in a
  sequence. The main thread, where all JavaScript code runs, can only do one task at a time, and there is no way to
  run multiple pieces of code in parallel on this thread. This might sound limiting, but JavaScriptâ€™s design is
  well-suited for handling many tasks efficiently, thanks to the event loop.</p>
  <p>
   <h1> How do Event loops work?</h1>
    <p>Call Stack:
    JavaScript uses a call stack to keep track of the currently executing function (where the program is in its
    execution).
    </p>
    <p>Callback Queue:
    Asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations or timers, are handled by the browser or Node.js runtime. When these
    operations are complete, corresponding functions (callbacks) are placed in the callback queue.</p>
    <p>Event Loop:
    The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the
    first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.</p>
    <p>Execution:
    The function on top of the call stack is executed. If this function contains asynchronous code, it might initiate
    further asynchronous operations.</p>
    <p>Callback Execution:
    When an asynchronous operation is complete, its callback is placed in the callback queue.</p>
    <p>Repeat:
    The event loop continues this process, ensuring that the call stack is always empty before taking the next function
    from the callback queue.</p>
